# Central Limit Theorem in Action

In this project, I try to prove that CLT works

## Steps
1. Generate multiple types of continuous probability distributions
2. Generate 10000 random samples, and calculate the average of each sample
3. Plot the averages, and make sure they fit the normal distribution

## Euler's number

I also tried to estimate the value of euler's number (e) using CLT
